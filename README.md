# Title of the Project
Human presence detection in Aerial Distress scenario photographs

----------------------------------------------

# Short Description and Objectives of the Project
The effectiveness of search and rescue missions from disaster scenarios such as earthquakes, floods, building collapses and fire accident hinges on the rapid identification of victims among debris and rubble. For large-scale areas affected, aerial surveillance with computer vision tools can play a pivotal role in detecting victims, facilitating prompt rescue operations and delivering medical aid. This project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art computer vision model capable of identifying human presence from aerial distress images, thereby improving the speed and accuracy of disaster response efforts.

# Requirements of this Project
- **Considered Data Mesaures:** The following image depicts the measures we took to achieve the goal of this project.
  
  | Dataset           | Variety                                                                 | Preprocessing Needed                                                                         | Rawness                                                                                     | Usability for Victim Detection                                           |
  |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | C2A               | Variety of disaster images with artificial human silhouette pre-embedded | Image resizing will be needed to bring all the images to uniform dimension.                | Usable for training for human detection application                                       | Focused on humans, with annotation to validate the model output|
  | Custom Dataset made from AIDER + UAV-Human | AIDER provides five different disaster backgrounds. UAV-Human provides 11,805 human poses as viewed from UAV | Custom developed engine to randomly overlay humans on the background and to generate annotation | The custom-generated data has actual humans in the background, aiding better feature learning | Focused on actual humans in the disaster environment for better learning|


- We followed 2 stages of finetuning.
  - C2A is used for initial fine tuning of the model and pruning the model architecture as it is a light-weight dataset with human centric focus.
  - Custom dataset from (AIDER+UAV-Human overlay) has more realistic human images and annotation over disaster background. Hence, this will be used for second level fine tuning.
- Feature extraction plan:
  - YoloV8, with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with image adaptation layer and fine tuning with above datasets phase wise is the planned approach.
  - We are also trying with YoloV9c, by customizing the backbone using various architectures to understand the performance of the human detection.
  - The methodology will be tuned further based on intermediate results.

----------------------------------------------

# Algorithms which can be used
- Fine-tune C2A train dataset using YOLOv7
- Fine-tune C2A train dataset with custom neck using YOLOv8n
- Fine-tune C2A train dataset using YOLOv9c

----------------------------------------------

# Issues to focus on

- Fine-tune YOLOv7 using the C2A train dataset.
  - Validate the obtained fine-tuned model using created custom validation dataset.

    - In `!unzip <</content/drive/MyDrive/human.zip>> -d /content/human` and ` !unzip <</content/drive/MyDrive/AIDER.zip>> -d /content/AIDER` steps, give the correct path of your HUMAN images and AIDER images. Don't change the destinations.
    - Except the last cell of the file, execute the entire file after updating the above items.
    - Now, update `drive_output_dir` with proper Google Drive path of your interest in the last cell of the file, and execute this as well.
    - Wait for sometime after executing these steps. Then go inside the path in your Google Drive and ensure your dataset is visible in it.

- Step-2: Download the C2A Dataset from Kaggle and Unzip it. Refer [Download_Dataset_from_Kaggle_and_Unzip.ipynb](https://github.com/kraviteja95/Human-Presence-Detection-in-Aerial-Distress-Scenario-Photographs/blob/main/Download_Datasets_and_Unzip/Download_Dataset_from_Kaggle_and_Unzip.ipynb) for better understanding.
  - Create a folder at the path of your interest in your Google Drive.
  - Open a Google Colab Notebook and execute the following steps to do the same:
    ```
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
      
    !wget "https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/rgbnihal/c2a-dataset" -O "{give your Google Drive folder path here}/C2A_Dataset.zip"

    !unzip "{give your Google Drive folder path here}/C2A_Dataset.zip" -d "{give your Google Drive folder path here}/C2A_Dataset"
    ```
  - Wait for sometime after executing these steps. Then go inside the path in your Google Drive and ensure your dataset is visible in it Refer [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--bTru0oVSulGZr9huJ5kF9vinU0O4Sa?usp=sharing) to understand how the created dataset structure looks like.

- Step-3: Fine-tune YOLOv7 models using the C2A and created Synthetic Datasets. 

  ***This will explain you how to Fine-tune the YOLOv7 model using the C2A train dataset and again fine-tuning the resultant model with the created synthetic train dataset.***
  
  - Ensure step-1 is successful before executing this.   
  - Take the [Yolov7_C2A_Custom.ipynb](https://github.com/kraviteja95/Human-Presence-Detection-in-Aerial-Distress-Scenario-Photographs/blob/main/C2A_and_CustomNewData_Yolo_v7/Yolov7_C2A_Custom.ipynb) file and open in your Google Colab.
